# event-lab frontend
### On Vue 3 + Vite + Vuex

This is the frontend on my new hobby project Event Lab.   
For now it runs with my Docker project "event-lab-server"

`npm i` to install on first download   
`npm run dev` to run the vite app

Edit your hostfile to point localhost to eventlab.com   
`> nano /etc/hosts`   
`127.0.0.1 eventlab.com` 

Add a SSL certificate to your system to trust the https connections.
