        <step-wrap step="1" label="Source">
            The UTM source identifies where your traffic comes from. When someone clicks this link and hits your site or content, what referred them there? Common sources for a UTM may include a website, search engine, or social network. Within a URL, the source UTM looks like this:
            -- --
            - utm_source=facebook
        </step-wrap>

        <step-wrap step="2" label="Medium">
            The UTM medium tells you how you shared your link with the audience. Common mediums for a UTM may include email, social, or PPC ads. Within a URL, the medium UTM looks like this:
            -- --
            - utm_medium=email
        </step-wrap>

        <step-wrap step="3" label="Name">
            The UTM campaign name tells you which campaign you’re promoting with the tag. This may be a specific promotion or an ongoing marketing effort. Keywords you may use in the UTM name include a product name, contest name, or type of sale. Within a URL, the campaign name looks like this:
            -- --
            - utm_name=content-analysis-tool
        </step-wrap>

        <step-wrap step="4" label="Campaign">
            - utm_campaign=mailing-webinar-2024
        </step-wrap>

        <step-wrap step="5" label="Term">
            The UTM term is most commonly used for paid campaigns. It tracks the relevant keywords for the campaign to tell you which ones referred traffic to your website. Within a URL, the campaign term looks like this:
            -- --
            - utm_term=analysis-tool
        </step-wrap>

        <step-wrap step="6" label="Content">
            The UTM content tag helps you determine what someone clicks to get to your website. It’s often used for ads or links that point to the same URL but come from different locations. You may use this code for A/B testing across a page or for content-targeted ads. Within a URL, the content tag may look like this:
            --
            - utm_content=blue-cta-button --
            or --
            - utm_content=green-cta-button
        </step-wrap>
